> Be really good at using lambda to encode inductive datatypes

- `nat-church.scm` -- re-org function to be symmetric to `nat-scott.scm` and `nat-parigot.scm`
- `nat-parigot.scm`

- read Fu Peng's lam note.

- read Aaron Stump's talk "Lambda Encodings Reborn"

- learn Aaron Stump's cedille: https://cedille.github.io

# docs

> It worth setup up a better documentation system now (with the help of readonly.link)
> - because updating code and playground links is painful

- readonly.link code block can link to playground
  - maybe we should do this for `suki` instead of `lambda`?
- play with birds -- a little book about birds

# idea

- add `fixpoint` as keyword to define recursive function (can be NbE-ed?)
  - we need to learn coq and lean -- i do not even know coq uses fixpoint

- add `object` and `class` to the language
  - view lambda as special object
  - since object is about name and orderlessness, it is orthogonal to lambda
