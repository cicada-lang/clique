# play

- play with fix & Y -- be super clear about using the idea of fix and the use of Y

  Do extra work each time,
  and get down to fundamentals,
  and study things until you understand them.
  - Richard Hamming
  - Lecture "Digital Filters, Part I" (April 27, 1995)

- play with birds

  a little book about birds

- Lambda the Ultimate Inductive Data

  - be good at using lambda to encode inductive datatypes
  - learn from kind's blog

- if we can use lambda to encode inductive datatypes,
  how about record types (with OOP in mind)?

  - we can view function as special object with an `apply` method,
    but how about encoding object by lambda?

- we need to learn coq and lean

  - i do not even know coq uses fixpoint
