# play

- lambda the ultimate inductive data

  - be good at using lambda to encode inductive datatypes -- learn from kind's blog

- play with birds -- a little book about birds

# idea

- add `fixpoint` as keyword to define recursive function (can be NbE-ed?)

  - we need to learn coq and lean -- i do not even know coq uses fixpoint

- encode record

  how to use lambda to encode tuple?
  if we have "reocrd-lambda", can we use it to encode record?
