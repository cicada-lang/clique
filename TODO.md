> mutual-recursive functions

- detected mutual-recursive function and print some thing

  - `Def` trace dependencies

- inline mutual-recursive function to simple recursive function
- test mutual-recursive function across modules

- implement lamping reduction by inet

- after this, we can use lambda encoding for real
- after using lambda encoding for real,
  we can get better understanding of inductive datatype
  - parameters v.s. indexes
