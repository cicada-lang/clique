# framework

- use laravel style route as API for syntax

# problems

- how to do term-graph implementation?

  Normal forms of Parigot numerals are exponential in size,
  but a reasonable term-graph implementation
  should be able to keep them linear via sharing.

# idea

- add `fixpoint` as keyword to define recursive function (can be NbE-ed?)
  - we need to learn coq and lean -- i do not even know coq uses fixpoint
