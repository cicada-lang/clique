- play with birds

  a little book about birds

- Lambda the Ultimate Inductive Data

  - be good at using lambda to encode inductive datatypes
  - learn from kind's blog

- if we can use lambda to encode inductive datatypes,
  how about record types (with OOP in mind)?

  - we can view function as special object with an `apply` method,
    but how about encoding object by lambda?

- we need to learn coq and lean

  - i do not even know coq uses fixpoint
