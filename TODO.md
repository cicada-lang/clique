> equality between recursive functions

- `fixpoint-neutral.ts`
- be able to `(assert-equal factorial (lambda (n) (factorial n)))`

> mutual-recursive functions

- detected **mutual-recursive** function and print some thing
- inline **mutual-recursive** function to simple recursive function
- test **mutual-recursive** function across modules

# graph-based implementation
