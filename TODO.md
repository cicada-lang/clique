- `EqualCtx` -- with `parentPairs` `leftParents` `rightParents`

- `Value` -- `equal` -- can handle recursion

  - (A) `equal` records the `path` during recursion

    - one lambda counts an `edge` of the `path`

# recursion

- `Value` -- `readback` -- limit length by a `count`

# play

- play with fix & Y
- play with birds
